## üì¶ Installation & Usage

1. Go to the [block.html](https://github.com/MachoPiggies/Undeb-UnionCloud-Clubs-Fix/blob/main/block.html) file and copy all of its contents

2. Go to your Undeb page, and in the white side panel, create a new page, call it "CSS stylesheet" (or something)
   
3. In that page, go to Advanced Settings and disable "Title Required" and "Include in site search"

4. Make sure it's expecting "HTML Content", once you've checked that, in the text editor, go to "Source" in the top left of the buttons, and paste the contents of [block.html](https://github.com/MachoPiggies/Undeb-UnionCloud-Clubs-Fix/blob/main/block.html) into it, and save
